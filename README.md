# Text Classification Model

Utilize machine learning algorithms such as random forest and gradient boosting to build an efficient and high performance models to classisfy each text belongs to one class.


## Technologies
 
 - Python: utilize python to build a sklearn pipeline to build and fine tune models. 
 - scikit learn: use popular ready implemented algorithms to train new models. 



## Workflow
- Build the pipeline which consists of a lot of estimators and convertors that help me to manage and construct any new pipeline I need to build easily.
- Convert text to embedings by applying transfer learning via popular pre-trained model (glove).
- Train and fine tune models.
